# Some BAMZOOKi contests by Shoe

These contests were made for the classic simulator (v3.1) but they can be added to Street Rules in a simular way.

If you just want to add the contests to your simulator, all you need to do is download this as a zip (found under code in the top right), unzip and follow the instructions below.

## To install:

- Copy all of the files in the contests folder and paste them into:

`C:\Program Files (x86)\BAMZOOKi\Contests\Contest Pack\`

- Copy "ContestPackShoe.dat" and paste it into:

`C:\Program Files (x86)\BAMZOOKi\ContestPacks\`

- The next time you run the simulator you should have these contests, enjoy!
