# Some BAMZOOKi contests by Shoe

These contests were made for the classic simulator (v3.1) but they can be added to Street Rules in a simular way.

If you just want to add the contests to your simulator, all you need to do is download this as a zip (found under code in the top right), unzip and follow the instructions below.

## To install:

- Copy all of the files (and folders) in the contests folder and paste them into:

`C:\Program Files (x86)\BAMZOOKi\Contests\Contest Pack\`

- Copy all of the files in `ContestPacks` and paste them into:

`C:\Program Files (x86)\BAMZOOKi\ContestPacks\`

- The next time you run the simulator you should have these contests, enjoy!


## To filter out contests:

Contests can be unlisted from the simulator with relative ease by removing their respective `.dat` file for example, if you wanted to unlist the template contests:

- Go to `C:\Program Files (x86)\BAMZOOKi\ContestPacks\`
- Remove `Templates.dat` (And possibly keep a copy)
- The next time you load the Simulator, the Blank/Template contests will not be listed
